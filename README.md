The AmigaPCI is a Motorola MC68040 based OCS/ECS Amiga computer in the ATX form factor. It provides five AUTOCONFIG PCI slots for expansion purposes such as video, sound, etc. Up to 256MB of fast RAM are supported on-board. The CPU and DMA chip RAM accesses are alternated, greatly increasing the speed of CPU chip RAM cycles without penalty to the DMA cycles. As a result of this design, the CPU can address 2MB of chip ram, regardless of the Agnus version installed.
