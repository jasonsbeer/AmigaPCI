## Project Status  
This is an active project and is currently in the prototype stage. See [Milestones and progress](milestones.md) for current status. Because this project is in the prototype stage, it is not recommended for general release at this time. There are likely errors that need to be corrected.

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.**

# Amiga Custom Chips  
The AmigaPCI must be populated with the Amiga OCS/ECS chips shown in Table 1. Reproductions in FPGA/CPLD may be used as well as the original equipment from Commodore. The Amiga chipset is required to enable critical functions of the Amiga computer.

Table 1. Amiga chipset.
Name|Chip ID|Commodore Part Number(s)|Quantity
-|-|-|-
Agnus|8372A or 8375||1
Denise|8362 or 8373||1
Paula|8364||1
CIA|8520A-1 or 8520PD|318029-03|2

# Kickstart ROM  
Kickstart ROM version 3.2 or greater for the Amiga 3000 should be burned to 100ns or faster 27C4096 EPROMs (DIP-40 footprint) for use by the AmigaPCI. Original Amiga Kickstart ROM footprints are not supported. 

# PCI Local Bus  
The PCI bus is based on the [PCI Local Bus Revision 2.3 specifications](/DataSheets/PCI/pci_23.pdf). The PCI Bridge implements a bidirectional asynchronous FIFO to facilitate data movements between the buses. Each slot is compatable with Universal and 5V PCI devices. All efforts are made to align implemented PCI features completely with the PCI Local Bus Revision 2.3. There are no undocumented PCI commands. Each slot is capable of supporting AUTOCONFIG for Amiga specific devices. Software configuration (Prometheus mode) is also available for non-Amiga specific hardware. The AmigaPCI supports true DMA, with each PCI device having total access to all PCI and Amiga address spaces.

# <a id="hid"></a>HID #  
The AmigaPCI support human interface devices (HID) via the two USB ports. Only keyboards and mice are supported at this time. Support is supplied via the on-board STM32F205 microcontroller, which translates the HID inputs into Amiga compatable signals. The mouse HID signals are shared with the JOY1 port (see [Mouse and Joystick](#mousejoystick)) via buffers. When there is active input from the HID mouse, the buffers are switched to only allow input from the HID port. When the HID mouse is not in active use, the buffers switch to allow input from JOY1. With this method, input from only one device is allowed at any time, with the mouse HID having priority.

# Ethernet  
Onboard ethernet will be supplied in the final production version. Exact details to be determined.

# Audio  
The audio output is generated by Paula and run through the filter circuit as in the Amiga 4000. The audio output is supplied from a line level 3.5mm stereo jack. A CD audio header is included to support the input of analog line-level audio from optical drives or other devices. It is a 4-pin 2.54 pitch connector in the RGGL footprint, with pin 1 = R. This may be installed as a standard 4-pin male header or TE Connectivity part 5-103639-3, which is the MPC-2 locking header that has become ubiquitous.

# Video  
The 15KHz standard Amiga video is output via an HD15 connector. This allows easy connection to converter boxes or any monitors that support the 15KHz standard. This connector only includes the signals needed for video output. Other signals present on the orignal Amiga video port are not included.

# <a id="mousejoystick"></a>Mouse and Joystick #
There are two legacy DB9 joystick port headers on the board. JOY1 is shared with the HID mouse input. In order to prevent signal contention with the HID mouse, the inputs from JOY1 are disconnected when the HID mouse is actively used. This prevents undesired behavior and allows only one device at a time to input signals, with the HID device having priority. See [HID](#hid). The input of JOY2 is not shared with other ports. 

# Serial  
The serial port is a male DB25 connector, which is stacked with the parallel female DB25 connector. The serial port is completely compatable with Amiga peripherals designed for the Amiga 500, 600, 1200, 2000, 3000, and 4000.

# Parallel  
The parallel port is a female DB25 connector, which is stacked with the serial male DB25 connector. The parallel port is completely compatable with legacy Amiga devices.

# Floppy Disk Drive  
The floppy disk interface is the primary way Amiga based computers store and retrieve external data. The AmigaPCI includes a header that supports two internal double density floppy disk drives. In the event two floppy disk drives (DF0 and DF1) are installed on the floppy disk drive header, J200 must have a jumper placed. When only one floppy disk drive is installed (DF0), there should be no jumper. See Table 2.

In addition to supporting original Amiga floppy disk drives, the AmigaPCI supports PC floppy disk drives in double density mode. An adaptation of Ian Steadman's [PC floppy interface](https://github.com/istedman/Floppy_adaptor) is implemented. The floppy drive hardware type (Amiga or PC) is set by the jumpers as shown in Table 3. When using high density disk drives with high density floppy disks, it may be necessary to cover the high density hole with tape to prevent the disk drive from attempting to use the disk as high density, which is not supported by the Amiga chipset. This may not be necessary for all high density floppy disk drive mechanisms.

**NOTE: You must use either Amiga disk drives or PC disk drives. Do not mix the two types.**

# ATA  
The AmigaPCI includes a dual-port host terminated ATA device interface. **More info to follow.**

# Video Slot  
The AmigaPCI includes the Amiga OCS/ECS video bus. This allows for the use of OCS/ECS compatable video devices with the AmigaPCI.

# Real Time Clock  
The real time clock (RTC) of the AmigaPCI is supplied by the STM32F205 microcontroller. When the RTC address space is active, the board controller signals the microcontroller with the associated request. The microcontroller then consumes or supplies the necessary data. The microcontroller is connected to an external crystal to supply an accurate clock signal for the microcontroller. The crystal is adjustable via the trim capacitor VC200.
