# AmigaPCI

The AmigaPCI is a Motorola MC68040 based OCS/ECS* Amiga computer in the ATX form factor. It provides four AUTOCONFIG capable PCI slots for expansion purposes such as video, sound, etc. Amiga OS and Kickstart 2.0+ is required for operation. 

* Original Chip Set and Enhanced Chip Set, respectively.

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Processor

The AmigaPCI is based on the Motorola MC68040 processor (MC68040 herein). The MC68040 has many advantages over previous generation Motorola processors. It includes an integrated floating point unit (FPU) as well as more efficient instruction execution, making it several time faster than the MC68030 processor at similar clock speeds. The MC68040 can be obtained for about the same price as the MC68030 + FPU.

### 1.2 Expansion Busses

The AmigaPCI includes expansion busses that allow for the user to expand the machine beyond its original capabilities.

#### 1.2.1 PCI

The PCI bus is based on the PCI Local Bus Revision 2.3 specifications[[2]](#2) and is discussed in detail in Section 2.

#### 1.2.2 Video Slot

The AmigaPCI includes the Amiga 2000/3000 video bus. This allows for any OCS/ECS compatable video device to be used with the AmigaPCI.

### 1.3 Amiga Chipset

The AmigaPCI must be populated with the Amiga OCS/ECS chips shown in table 1.3 in order to function properly. Reproductions in FPGA/CPLD may be used as well as the original equipment from Commodore. The Amiga chipset is required to enable basic functioning of the Amiga computer.

Table 1.3. Amiga chipset.
Name|Chip ID|Commodore Part Number(s)|Quantity

Agnus|8372A or 8375||1
Denise|8362 or 8373||1

CIA|8520A||2

### 1.4 Floppy Disk Drives

Although deprecated for many years, the floppy disk interface is the primary way Amiga based computers store and retrieve external data. The AmigaPCI includes a header that supports two internal double density floppy disk drives. In the event two floppy disk drives (DF0 and DF1) are installed on the floppy disk drive header, J200 must have a jumper placed. When only one floppy disk drive is installed (DF0), there should be no jumper.

### 1.5 Integrated Device Electronics (IDE)

The AmigaPCI includes a buffered, host terminated Gayle compatible AUTOBOOT* IDE port for hard drives and ATAPI** devices. The IDE port complies with the ATA/ATAPI Revision 4[[1]](#1) standard. The IDE port supports two devices (master and slave). For instructions on installing a new hard drive on Amiga computers, refer to the [Commodore Hard Drive User's Guide](DataSheet/Hard_Drive_Users_Guide.pdf). This includes the HDToolBox user guide and other useful information for setting up both IDE and SCSI devices.

*AUTOBOOT requires Kickstart v37.300 or greater or compatible scsi.device in Kickstart.  
**ATAPI support included in Kickstart 3.1.4+. Older versions of Kickstart may require installation of third party ATAPI drivers.  

### 1.6 Human Interface Devices (HID)

The AmigaPCI support human interface devices (HID) via the two USB ports. Only keyboards and mice are supported. Support is supplied via the on-board STM32F205RET7 (OR STM32F207VE
) microcontroller, which translates the HID inputs into Amiga compatable signals. The mouse HID signals are shared with the JOY1 port (see 1.8.4) via a 74LVC245 buffer. HID input to the shared port is only active when the HID mouse is actively being used. When the HID mouse is not actively being used, the buffer outputs are tristate and will not adversely affect input from a device on JOY1. HID keyboards are supported with no option for legacy Amiga keyboards. 

**NOTE:** Using an HID mouse and a device on JOY1 at the same time will result in udersireable behavior.

### 1.7 Audio

The audio output is generated by Paula and run through the filter circuit as in the Amiga 4000. The audio output is supplied from a line level 3.5mm stereo jack. A CD audio header is included on the board.

### 1.8 HDMI Video

HDMI video output is possible through the use of the RGB2HDMI Raspberry Pi Zero header on the board. The interface circuitry is incorporated on the AmigaPCI board. To provide HDMI video, install the RGB2HDMI software for the Amiga on a Raspberry Pi Zero and attach it to the Raspberry Pi Zero header. Connect a video cable to the Raspberyy Pi Zero and route it out of the case via card bracket or an opening in the case. The Raspberry Pi Zero  is installed "face down". Installing the Raspberry Pi incorrectly may damage to the Raspberry Pi and the AmigaPCI board.

### 1.8 Legacy User Ports

#### 1.8.1 Parallel

The parallel port is a female DB25 connector, which is stacked with the serial male DB25 connector. The parallel port is completely compatable with legacy Amiga devices.

#### 1.8.2 Serial

The serial port is a male DB25 connector, which is stacked with the parallel female DB25 connector. The serial port is completely compatable with Amiga peripherals designed for the Amiga 500, 600, 1200, 2000, 3000, and 4000.

#### 1.8.4 Legacy Joystick and Mouse Ports

There are two legacy joystick port headers on the board. JOY1 is always active and is shared with the HID mouse input. See 1.6.

**NOTE:** Using an HID mouse and a device on JOY1 at the same time will result in udersireable behavior.

### 1.9 15KHz Video

The 15KHz standard Amiga video is output via an HD15 connector. This allows easy connection to converter boxes or any monitors that support the 15KHz standard. This connector only includes the signals needed for video output. Other signals present on the orignal Amiga video port are not included.

### 1.10 Real Time Clock

The real time clock (RTC) of the AmigaPCI uses the RTC of the STM32F205RET7 microcontroller. When the RTC address space is active, the board controller signals the microcontroller with the associated request. The microcontroller then either consumes or supplies the necessary data in the correct format. The microcontroller is connected to an external crystal to supply an accurate clock signal for the microcontroller. The crystal is adjustable via the trim capacitor VC200.

### 1.11 Chipset RAM

Chip RAM is supplied by SDRAM via the board controller.

#### 1.11.1 Slow RAM

The CPU can access the chipset RAM through Agnus. Because this process is mediated through Agnus, this RAM is referred to as "Slow RAM". The RAM controller must adhear to MC68000 timings. The process is as follows:

1) The CPU drives A1..20 in the chipset RAM address space and drives the data bus and R_W low for write cycles.
2) The CPU asserts _TIP to indicate the address and data (for write cycles) is valid.
3) The RAM controller asserts _AS, _LDS, _UDS, and _RAMEN on the falling 7MHz edge (S1) to indicate CPU access to Agnus. According to Commodore technical publications, _AS should only be asserted when both C1 and C3 are low, otherwise a 7MHz wait state is to be inserted.
4) Agnus drives _WE low for write cycles.
5) On the rising edge of C3, Agnus drives a valid _RAS address on MA0 - MA9 (S2).
6) On the rising edge of C1, Agnus drives a valid _CAS address on MA0 - MA9 (S3).
7) On the first falling edge of BCLK after entering MC68000 S6, the RAM controller drives the _RAS address to the SDRAM with a bank activate command.
8) On the next falling edge of BCLK, the RAM controller drives the _CAS address to the SDRAM with a read or write command.
9) For read cycles, after any latency requirements, data is driven to the data bus by the SDRAM. Write cycles are latched immediately with the _CAS command.
10) On the next falling edge of BCLK, _TA and _TBI are asserted by the board controller to signal the MC68040 to complete the cycle and inhibit burst transfers.

See [Timing Diagram](</DataSheets/TimingDiagrams/CPU Chip Register and Slow RAM.png>)

NOTE: Agnus is RAS only refresh. SDRAM refresh is handled by the RAM controller and is independent of the Agnus refresh command. An Agnus refresh cycle can be recognized by the assertion of _RAS0 and _RAS1 simultaneously, which will only happen during refresh cycles.

#### 1.11.2 Chipset DMA

_DBR is asserted for chipset RAM DMA cycle.

### 1.12 Ethernet

Ethernet 10/100 is provided via the STM32F207VE microcontroller. It is set up as a 16 bit device and responds in the address space $000D 8000 - 000D 8FFF. This is the address space defined as "spare" in the Gayle specification, this, it should be a safe space to use. SANA II drivers will need to be adapted to this and the code to handle the communication interface between the MC68040 bus and ethernet will need to be developed.

## 2. PCI Bus

The AmigaPCI is designed to comply with the PCI Local Bus Revision 2.3 specificiation. Each slot supports Universal and 5V cards, as defined in the PCI Local Bus Revision 2.3 specification. Like Zorro 2 and Zorro 3, PCI supports auto configuration of devices on power up. This allows, via some translation, for the use of Amiga AUTOCONFIG to configure devices at start up. This fits well with Amiga OS as each device is configured as a Zorro 3 device, which function natively with Amiga OS. 

By definition, the PCI Local Bus is a processor independent, 32 bit expasion bus. The AmigaPCI PCI Bus is implemented via a MC68040 to PCI bridge using a PCI Controller ASIC concept. The PCI Controller Logic translates data requests from the Motorola MC68040 and PCI devices in order that they may communicate in an effective manner. 

### 2.1 Endianness

Motorola MC68000 series processors are big endian devices. PCI devices, by contrast, are little endian devices. This means we must byte swap the data signals to provide compatability between devices with different endianness[[1]](#1). The AmigaPCI implements address (or byte) invariance to implement the endian conversion. Any devices created for the AmigaPCI must be designed as little endian, as defined in the PCI Local Bus Specifications[[2]](#2).

*Most significant bit.

**NOTE:** For the purposes of this project, a bus's most significant bit will be listed first and least significant last. For example, [31..0] indicates bit 31 as the most significant bit. Zero is the least. Thus, [31..0] indicates a little endian device. The opposite will be true for a big endian device.

### 2.2 PCI Configuration

Each slot is capable of auto configuration via the Amiga OS AUTOCONFIG process. During configuration, each PCI slot, in turn, is polled to obtain the capabilities and address space needs of the target device. At startup, each PCI slot is polled by asserting the IDSEL signal. The IDSEL signal is approximately equivalent to the _CFGIN signal of the Zorro bus. However, unlike the _CFGIN signal, the IDSEL is asserted by a specific address bit during the address phase of a configuration command access[[2]](#2) (Table 2.2a). PCI configuration header Type 0 is supported by the PCI Controller logic.

Table 2.2a
PCI Slot|Address Bit
-|-
0|AD[11]
1|AD[12]
2|AD[13]
3|AD[14]

#### 2.2.1 AUTOCONFIG

During configuration, specifications such as the device manufacturer, product number, device capabilities, etc, are read from the device. Each PCI device is capable of supporting up to six base address registers (BAR0 - BAR5, between 0x10 - 0x24). At this time, the required address space for each of the six possible registers are determined and presented to Amiga OS for assigning of base addresses in the 32 bit MC68040 address space. This is done through the normal Zorro 3 AUTOCONFIG procedure. However, the PCI Controller logic translates the needs of the PCI card and requests AUTOCONFIG resources in a manner that is understood by Amiga OS. As an example, if BAR0 requests 512k of configuration space, this request will be passed to Amiga OS as a Zorro 3 device requiring 512k of AUTOCONFIG space. Amiga OS will then assign a base address to this request. This assigned base address will then be programmed into BAR0 of the PCI device. This process repeats for BAR1 - BAR5 of the same PCI device. This procedure is then repeated for each PCI device installed further down the configuration chain. Once complete, each PCI device may be accessed by the assigned base address(es), just as any other AUTOCONFIG device.

One drawback to this process is the PCI device manufacturer ID (assigned by the PCI Special Interest Group) is non-exclusive with the Amiga OS manfacturer ID (as was assigned by Commodore Applications and Technical Support). This may result in misinterpretation of the manufacturer by Amiga OS. It is unknown at this time if this may result in hardware or software failures.

#### 2.2.2 ROM Vector

PCI devices may have onboard ROMs that contain additional information describing the device and may be used to enhance functionality, such as for auto booting. PCI ROMs may contain multiple images that support multiple architectures. During PCI configuration, the ROM address requirement is read from the PCI configuration header. This is then presented to the AUTOCONFIG process as a ROM Vector.

MORE DETAIL...HOW DOES THIS WORK?

### 2.3 Interrupt Handling

Each PCI slot has four interrupt signals, identified as _INTA, _INTB, _INTC, and _INTD. Single function PCI devices are only allowed to use _INTA. The remaining signals are only used in the event of a multifunction PCI device, with one interrupt line per pci function. As a hyptothetical example, a multifunction I/O device may use _INTA for a floppy drive interface, _INTB for a hard drive interface, _INTC for a serial interface, etc. For the purposes of the AmigaPCI design, _INTA, _INTB, _INTC, and _INTD are OR'd together and connected to _INT2. Driver design should look for assertion of _INT2 to signal an interrupt request from devices on the PCI bus. When an interrupt is asserted, the driver needs to poll its device on the PCI bus to determine if its device is asserting the interrupt.

### 2.4 Bus Mastering

Direct access activities are available to the MC68040 and PCI cards via bus mastering. When a device has mastered the bus, it has control of the entire AmigaPCI system and may directly access any valid address location. This is typically done for direct reading and writing of memory or direct control of chipset or other functions. The AmigaPCI bus arbiter accepts bus requests from the MC608040 and the PCI bus. Each slot on the PCI bus has a dedicated bus request signal. The bus arbiter will grant the bus to highest priority device when the current bus cycle is complete. See Table 2.4. In the event there is not pending bus request, the MC68040 is given explicit ownership until it begins a bus cycle or a bus request from one of the PCI devices is asserted.

Table 2.4. Bus arbitration priority.
Device|Priority
-|-
PCI Slot 0|0 (Greatest)
PCI Slot 1|1
PCI Slot 2|2
PCI Slot 3|3
MC68040|4 (Least)

#### 2.4.1 MC68040 Bus Mastering

Unlike previous Motorola MC68000 series processors, the MC68040 does not preferentially own the bus. It is considered for bus access with all other bus mastering devices on the system. Thus, bus arbitration includes the MC68040 when assigning bus ownership. When it is ready to take ownership of the system bus, if there is no bus cycle in progress, the MC68040 will assert _BR to indicate its need to own the system bus. If appropriate, the bus arbiter will assert _BG in response so that the MC68040 may begin its bus activities. Once _BG is asserted by the arbiter, the MC68040 will assert _BB to indicate ownership of the bus. _BG is asserted until the MC68040 bus access is complete, indicated by negation of _BR. While posessing explicit ownership of the bus, the MC68040 may start a bus cycle at any time asserting _BR and _BB. Alternatively, the MC68040 may leave the bus idle when there are no bus operations necessary. In that case, _BR is negated and _BB is tri-state.

#### 2.4.2 PCI Bus Mastering

When a PCI device is ready to take ownership of the system bus, it will assert _REQx, where x is the slot designation of the device (0-3). Once any current bus cycle has completed (_BB is negated) the arbiter will assert _BB to indicate a bus operation is in progress. It will simultaneously assert _GNTx, allowing the requesting PCI device to take ownership of the bus and begin its operation. _GNTx and _BB will remain asserted until _REQx is negated. At that time, _GNTx will be negated and _BB will be negated.
