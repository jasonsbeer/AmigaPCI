The gerbers are in the appropriate folder. Pick and place files and JLCPCB BOMs with parts numbers are also found in each folder. File names containing "SMT" are surface mount components only. File names containing "ALL PARTS" include SMT and through hole parts. Not all parts are necessarily populated in the BOM, as dictated by availability and (crazy) price at the time the files were created. Previous revision hardware can be found in the Archive folder.
