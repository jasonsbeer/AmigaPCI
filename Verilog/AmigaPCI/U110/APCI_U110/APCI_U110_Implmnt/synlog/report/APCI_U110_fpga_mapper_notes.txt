@N: MF666 |Clock conversion enabled. (Command "set_option -fix_gated_and_generated_clocks 1" in the project file.)
@N: MT204 |Auto Constrain mode is disabled because clocks are defined in the SDC file
@N: FX1016 :"d:\amigapci\u110\u110_top.v":34:10:34:14|SB_GB_IO inserted on the port CLK40.
@N: BW103 |The default time unit for the Synopsys Constraint File (SDC or FDC) is 1ns.

@N: MT615 |Found clock CLK40 with period 25.00ns 
@N: MT615 |Found clock CLK33 with period 30.30ns 
@N: MT320 |This timing report is an estimate of place and route data. For final timing results, use the FPGA vendor place and route report.
@N: MT322 |Clock constraints include only register-to-register paths associated with each individual clock.
@N: MT582 |Estimated period and frequency not reported for given clock unless the clock has at least one timing path which is not a false or a max delay path and that does not have excessive slack
